# African Researchers in top CV/ML Venues
We gather through automated ways from Scopus indexed publications and retrieving the affiliation history of authors to identify African authors who are publishing with non African institutions. We here list the African authors that were identified using this mechanism. Note that authors who weren't able to publish back with African institutions are unfortunately not part of this set as it was created automatically.
